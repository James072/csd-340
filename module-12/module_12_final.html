                        Throughout my life, I've been exposed to different genres of music from a very young age - <br>
                        classical, jazz, gospel, opera - you name it.  But from the age of 12, Hip Hop grabbed a hold
                        of me and never let go!  I threw my hat into the ring and became an emcee (M-C), freestyling
                        about random stuff until age 15, when I realized I needed to start writing rhymes down on 
                        paper.  I named myself Jay Money and 2 years later, I met my long-time producer and good 
                        friend, Todd "DJ Suicide" Reese.  I started out rapping the intros to his mixtapes, and 
                        the rest is history!  The three covers pictured above are projects that I was directly
                        involved with.  The first was with my crew, Da Basement Society, during the 90's, and 
                        later, I released a solo mixtape and a solo album.  I guess you could say this has been
                        a little more than a hobby.<br>

                    Hi!  My name is James and I'm a watch collecting addict!  To say that I love watches is an 
                    understatement.  When I was a kid, my grandfather used to always have me set the time on his 
                    new watches, and then tell me that "every man should have a good watch!"  Then, he and my 
                    grandmother gave me a chunky, stainless-steel Timex for my 13th birthday.  My addiction 
                    started off small, buying cheap watches from bootleg spots and boosters (a shoplifter who
                    operates in the streets!).  But when the first rechargeable watches hit the scene, I had 
                    to have one, so I started spending more money.  I was also a member of an online watch 
                    club that sent me a new watch every month, but I canceled that, as it was starting to
                    get out of hand.  In 2011, I discovered Invicta watches and got sprung again!  I currently
                    have enough watches to wear a different watch everyday for two months without repeating.
                    Watches are my drugs!

                    My natural talent is my skill to write.  I started out writing short stories as a kid, and then
                    in junior high, I served as sports editor of my school's newspaper.  My ability to write is what
                    lead me into writing rap lyrics.  When we ran our independent label during the 90's, I wrote all
                    of the bios for artist press kits.  A goal of mine is to have a published work, and I'm currently
                    working on a book titled "A Father's Right," which chronicles the events of the 2-year court dispute
                    in which I gained custody of my son (there's a movie deal in this, I know it!).

                        From 2003 until 2018 (13 years), I worked for an employer that owned two convenience store/gas stations
                        directly across the street from each other in north Omaha - BJ's and Ames Avenue.  In 2006, I was promoted
                        to manager over the night shift, which would have been easy had it not been for the surrounding elements of
                        this particular environment.  During my time there, I witnessed shootings, fights, a man murdered in the 
                        store during the day shift....I probably would have quit earlier, but the pay was good and allowed me to 
                        fight for custody of my son, who has special needs.  In 2018, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I quit and 
                        registered for school.

                        I left the well-paying, dead-end job and registered for school.  I had a small amount of experience
                        with HTML, but that's it.  When registering, I was asked what I wanted to do.  My answer was, "I want 
                        to learn how to program."  While at Metro, I took Java 1 & 2, Python 1 & 2, 2 SQL courses, database
                        design and data center operations, XML, Web Page Development, just to name a few.  To make ends meet, 
                        I worked part-time as a car detailer for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and later worked at the bookstore/coffee 
                        shop on the Metro campus (not work study) until May of this year.  I earned my associate degree in 
                        Information Technology, Programming for Database and Web Design in November of 2021 (took a summer off 
                        to work), and participated in the commencement ceremony back in May of 2022.

                        When researching IT jobs, many employers are requiring candidates to have a bachelors degree, according to the 
                        job postings.  I decided to take it to the next level and transferred to Bellevue University.  I entered into 
                        the accelerated cohort because I felt that being older, I didn't have time to pursue this degree over a four-
                        year period; a year and a half sounded more feasible.  It's been hard, with trying to juggle a special-need 
                        son, going back to full-time work, and the death of close family members.  I refuse to stop, regardless to 
                        having a couple of bad quarters.  You have to pick yourself up and continue to strive towards accomplishing
                        the goal.
